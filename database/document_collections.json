With these is used a finger protector of leather, which is worn over the little finger of the right hand, the twine being tightly wound around the hand and pressing against the finger. The width of a net was measured by the number of meshes, and the length by the number of \"arm spreads\"...An average size is 19 meshes wide and 60 arm spreads long. Pieces of light wood about 12 inches long are fastened to the edge of the net as \"floaters,\" and opposite each is a stone \"sinker.\" The distance between these is twice a single \"arm length.\"", "bibliography": "Frances Densmore, Chippewa Customs (St. Paul:  Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1979) 154.", "url": "/collection/densmore-on-making-fish-nets"}, {"type": "document", "title": "HIlger describing net materials", "description": "Originally published in 1951 by the Smithsonian Institution Bureau of American Ethnology as Bulletin 146.", "documentbody": "A Red Lake informant, a professional net maker, in making nets used cord made from the inner bark of the basswood.
